## Election-Audit Summary: 
The election audit process used python to only read in the election data.  The data 
was provided by the congressional district in a CVS file.  The CSV file did not contain any voter information, 
only the candidateâ€™s name as the vote.  The same election audit process can be used for auditing any other 
congressional districts provide the same information is received.  The audit also produced a printed copy of 
the results to be certified by election officials for the congressional district.

Python is a powerful tool that can be used to analyze any data that requires counting or arithmetic to 
provide statistical information for decision making
